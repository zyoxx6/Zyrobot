`pyngrok` is a Python wrapper for `ngrok` that manages its own binary, making `ngrok` available via a convenient Python
API and the command line.

[`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com) is a reverse proxy that opens secure tunnels from public URLs to localhost. It's perfect
for rapid
development (test webhooks, demo local websites, enable SSH access), establishing ingress to external
networks and devices, building production APIs (traffic policies, OAuth, load balancing), and more. And
it's made even more powerful with native Python integration through the `pyngrok` client.

## Installation

`pyngrok` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyngrok/) and can be installed
using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pyngrok
```

or `conda`:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge pyngrok
```

That's it! `pyngrok` is now available as a package to your Python projects, and `ngrok` is now available from
the command line.

## Basic Usage

### Open a Tunnel

To open a tunnel, use the [`connect`](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.connect) method,
which returns a [`NgrokTunnel`](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.NgrokTunnel), and this
returned object has a reference to the public URL generated by `ngrok` in its [`public_url`](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.NgrokTunnel.public_url)
attribute.

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok

# Open a HTTP tunnel on the default port 80
# <NgrokTunnel: "https://<public_sub>.ngrok.io" -> "http://localhost:80">
http_tunnel = ngrok.connect()

# Open a SSH tunnel
# <NgrokTunnel: "tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345" -> "localhost:22">
ssh_tunnel = ngrok.connect("22", "tcp")

# Open a named tunnel from the config file
named_tunnel = ngrok.connect(name="my-config-file-tunnel")

# Open an Internal Endpoint that's load balanced
# <NgrokTunnel: "https://some-endpoint.internal" -> "http://localhost:9000">
internal_endpoint = ngrok.connect(addr="9000",
                                  domain="some-endpoint.internal",
                                  pooling_enabled=True)
```

The [`connect`](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.connect) method takes `kwargs` as well,
which allows
you to pass additional tunnel configurations that are supported by `ngrok` (or the `name` of a tunnel defined in
`ngrok`'s config file), [as documented here](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tunnel-configurations).

### `ngrok`'s API

The [`api`](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.api) method allows you to use the local
`ngrok` agent to make requests against [the `ngrok` API](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/cli-api/), if you
have [set an API key](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#setting-the-authtoken-or-api-key).
For example, here's how you would reserve a `ngrok` domain, then create a Cloud Endpoint with an associated traffic
policy:

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok

domain = "some-domain.ngrok.dev"
ngrok.api("reserved-domains", "create",
          "--domain", domain)
ngrok.api("endpoints", "create",
          "--bindings", "public",
          "--url", f"https://{domain}",
          "--traffic-policy-file", "policy.yml")
```

### Command Line Usage

This package puts the default `ngrok` binary on your path, so all features of `ngrok` are
available on the command line.

```sh
ngrok http 80
```

For details on how to fully leverage `ngrok` from the command line,
see [`ngrok`'s official documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/agent/cli/).
